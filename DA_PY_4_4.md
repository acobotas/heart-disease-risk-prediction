Now, it is time for you to apply your knowledge independently by analyzing the [Cardiovascular Study Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christofel04/cardiovascular-study-dataset-predict-heart-disea).

> After downloading the dataset, please use the *train.csv* file for the graded task.

<br>

# Objective

- Practice predictive modeling.

<br>

# Task

Your task is to perform an analysis and fit a logistic regression model for predicting the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). The structure of your Jupyter notebook should be exactly the same as in the hands-on task, with the following addition:

- Choose the most appropriate classification metric for this problem and calculate the optimal threshold. Provide arguments to support your decision.

<br>

## Evaluation Criteria

- How well the model creation in the task description is followed
- You can explain how you selected which variables to include in the model and which transformations to apply
- You can interpret the models' performance metrics and coefficients
- Your presentation is fluent and clear. The Presentation should take 10-15 minutes
- Python best practices followed
- General understanding of the topic
- Analytical approach to the problem. Did you use analysis to provide justified, useful, and actionable insights?
